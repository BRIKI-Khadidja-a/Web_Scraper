# **E-Job Tracker**

**Compare and Monitor Job Offers Across Multiple Countries**

---

##  Project Idea

Our project aims to **scrape job offer data** (such as job title, company name, location, and job link) from **different job websites in three different countries**.  

Each team member is responsible for **one country**, using Python web scraping tools to extract job offers from a popular local job platform.  

All the collected data will be **combined and displayed in a desktop application**, allowing users to:
 
- **Compare job offers** across different countries.  
- **Track new job postings** and observe hiring trends internationally.

##  How It Works

### 1. Scraping Phase  
- Each member writes a Python script that extracts job title, company name, location, and job link from a website in their assigned country.  
- The data is cleaned and saved in a consistent format (CSV file or database).  

### 2. Data Storage  
- All scripts store their data in a shared database.  
- Each update includes timestamps to track when each job was scraped.  

### 3. Analysis Phase  

- It can show **statistics and trends**, such as which countries have the most openings or which companies hire frequently.  

### 4. Desktop Application  
 
- Provides an interactive interface to **view, search, and filter job offers** .  
- Includes clickable links to open the job listing directly in a browser.

## Expected Output

- A **functional desktop application** that lists and compares job offers from **three countries**.  
- Ability to **update job data regularly**.  
- A **local database or CSV file** storing all scraped job data.  
-  **statistics** showing international job trends.
